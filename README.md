# DSP-Synthesis-Library
Basic DSP library for synthesis developed during my undergraduate internship at LIM (Universit√† Statale di Milano).

The library is organized in modules, where each one carries out individual tasks.
In the following, the modules are introduced.

### Table Look-Up Synthesis
- **Wavetable**: Builds a wavetable and allows to access to its content using indexes. Derived from Table.
- **TableLookUp**: Reads a wavetable. Assuming that the table contains exactly one cycle, it allows to choose the frequency being played.

### Volume Controller
- **Copy Channel**: Copy source channels in destination channel. Allows to the conversion of mono signals into stereo.
- **Gain**: Applies a multiplicative factor to a mono signal.
- **Panner**: Applies multiplicative factors on stereo signal.

### Additional Code
- **Table**: Abstract class from which the Wavetable module inherits from.
- **BusaccaLibrary**: Includes the header files.
- **BusaccaDefinitions**: Includes definitions.
- **Redwood**: Code utilities taken from the Redwood tutorials ( http://www.redwoodaudio.net/Tutorials/juce_for_vst_development__intro.html ). Useful for Juce projects.
